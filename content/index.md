Hi, 

I am an Engineering Manager by profession and a Computer Science lover!

From a very early age, I have been programming - building small computer games, automating formulas to make homework easier, etc.

However, I fell in love with computer science back in college when I tried creating my own game engine - creating pseudo intelligence, optimizing game loops, applying a variety of design patterns - these taught me most of what I know today.

I got placed into one of the top MNCs in my college placements, but I left it and traveled to Bangalore to join the Startup Ecosystem in India. My aim - to witness the fascinating world of Indian startups and become a part of it.

4 years down the line - I am in the frontlines of one of the best SAAS Startups in India. 

I have had the chance to work in deep backend & frontend work, setup architecture of many applications, develop them end to end, act as a recruiter for my company, mentor multiple people at the same time, and lead a team of highly talented and diverse sets of people.

I love meeting people and it would be my pleasure to get to know you!
